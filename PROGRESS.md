# Progress

## Maintenance note

> This file holds what is **not** done: features not yet built, bugs not yet
> fixed, and open questions - the opposite list from `Completed.md`.
>
> **The rule that keeps the two files honest:** when an item here is fixed or
> built and fully verified - the relevant test suites pass (backend suites run
> against the live services; a browser check by hand or via Playwright where
> an HTTP test cannot see the bug), and any doc claim about it has been
> checked against the real, running product rather than assumed - move its
> write-up out of this file and into `Completed.md`, appended at the end of
> "Completed Work" with the next number. Do not leave a finished item
> described in both places, and do not describe an unfinished one only in
> `Completed.md`. A partially-done fix (code written, suite not yet run; one
> surface verified, another still assumed) stays here until every piece of it
> is actually verified.
>
> Reviewed and updated at the end of every session, same as before - what
> changed is which file a finished item goes in, not whether it gets written
> down.

## Features Not Yet Built

**The assistant is not installable.** A React component in our storefront, not a
script tag a merchant adds to their site.

**No gate runs the browser tests.** The Playwright layer exists
(`storefront/tests/checkout.spec.ts`, run with `npm test`) but nothing wires it
into a daily or pre-commit gate — it still runs when somebody remembers to run it.
The class of bug the finger-pointing in `Completed.md` kept hitting is now
catchable, just not yet caught automatically.

**A published reliability number.** `eval.py` exists and is unfinished. Nobody in
this market publishes one.

**No Postgres, no hosting, no repo split.** SQLite by connection string, local only.
The operations console shares a bundle with the shopper storefront, which is why the
operator key must be typed rather than built in.

## Known Issues / Pending

Reported after a walkthrough. **Not a complete list** - walk the product before
trusting anything.

**Occasional near-duplicate assistant messages** from the poll's deduplication -
the last real behaviour bug, browser-only. One reproduction attempt so far
(see `Completed.md`'s standing-lesson entries for the general practice this
follows): delayed the transcript poll's GET by 4s with Playwright network
interception, then fired several rapid model-free chat taps while that poll
was still in flight - the exact shape the `useEffect`'s stale-closure
structure (it depends on `turns`, which changes on every tap, tearing down
and rebuilding the interval and its `seen` snapshot each time) suggested
could cause it. It did not reproduce: three taps, three correct distinct
replies, no duplicates or drops. The one shape already known to cause a
near-duplicate - the pay endpoint prepending a sentence, making the stored
turn a suffix of what's shown - is already handled by the existing suffix
check, so whatever is still causing the reported duplicates is a narrower or
different timing window than the one tried. Worth retrying with a different
trigger (two consecutive poll cycles overlapping, or a race specifically with
an operator's approval writing into the session mid-poll) rather than more of
the same race shape. Reproducing this costs real model calls under the Groq
throttle, which slows down each attempt but is not why it remains unfixed -
the bug itself is a frontend timing issue independent of which model, or
whether one, is behind the chat.

A case can get stuck in `DIAGNOSED` state with no path to resolution - needs a
deliberate lifecycle-semantics decision before touching it. The code does
close the case out via `record_outcome`, so it is not literally orphaned, but
using `DIAGNOSED` as a terminal state for "needs a choice" is semantically odd.

Closing a handover with a blank note tells the shopper nothing by design,
which is worth revisiting rather than an obvious bug.

### Why the tests did not used to catch these

**None of them could see the browser.** Every UI-state bug found by hand lived
in React state against `sessionStorage` - state held in two places, effects
firing in the wrong order, stale closures - and the HTTP suites never drove a
real browser. `storefront/tests/checkout.spec.ts` (see `Completed.md`, #21) is
the first thing that watches the actual browser. The remaining Known Issues
above are still disproportionately the kind no HTTP test can see - a next pass
should extend the Playwright suite to them rather than reach for
`healthcheck.py` again.

## Next Steps

1. Still open: a handover message written for a guest's dying session (guests
   no longer pay, but can still chat and still get escalated), and the shop
   now prompts for an email where it used to finish a sale - whether that
   nudges a merchant's conversion is worth watching.
2. The browser-level test layer now exists (`storefront/tests/checkout.spec.ts`,
   `npm test` from `storefront/`) - extend it rather than starting a second one.
   Best next addition: the near-duplicate-message poll bug, now the only real
   behaviour Known Issue still open. Reproduce it in the browser first with a
   different trigger (see Known Issues above) rather than repeating the same
   race shape already tried once.
3. The remaining Known Issues are not architectural; the `DIAGNOSED`-stuck item
   is a lifecycle-semantics decision that wants a deliberate call, and the
   blank-note handover is a deliberate behaviour worth revisiting rather than
   an obvious bug.
4. Webhooks are built (Kettle only - see `Completed.md`, #31). Of what remains
   unbuilt, the installable widget is the next thing standing between the
   engine and a merchant actually adding it to their own site; a CI gate for
   the browser tests, `eval.py`'s reliability number, and Postgres/hosting are
   all valuable but not load-bearing for onboarding a first real merchant.
